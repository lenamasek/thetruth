					With 'vibrant' comes pulsating, bright, lively, exuberant. There is electricity inside you, keeping you going. You may feel at times like you’re only going through the motions, but you have so much potential and energy inside you. You can do great things. </h2><h2>
You might be dealing with depression or anxiety or another physical/biological/mental illness that keeps you from feeling vibrantly alive. That’s okay – you can’t control how you feel and sometimes you can’t control what’s going on in your body, either. If you’re going through a tough experience, you may feel like vibrance is unattainable, but it’s not. Seek out vibrance and work toward it. Take baby steps toward bright, lively energy. Don’t give up.
