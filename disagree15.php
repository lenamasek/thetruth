					Think about all the tough times you've gone through. Okay, don't think too hard about it. Think about how you’re still here, reading this message. There might have been times where you didn’t think you’d make it this far. Whether it was – or is – chronic depression, a difficult break up, or a serious injury, it can feel like someone out there is rooting for us to fail.</h2>
		<h2>			
You didn’t fail, and you’re not failing now. The world is messed up and you’re constantly jumping through hoops, trying to find your way through it and make it to tomorrow. You bounce back and keep fighting. You’re great and capable. Don’t give up.
