					We all are capable of innovative ideas, creative works, and revolutionary actions. You can lead a movement of people, create a wildly popular art piece, or share love and kindness with others. All of those things (and more) are incredible and make a big impact on the world around you.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					You may feel like you don't have the resources or skills to create change in your world, but you do. Something as simple and complex as showing love to your neighbor can make an unimaginable amount of change. Think of things you can do to serve your friends, family, neighbors, classmates, or coworkers and just start there – see what comes of a small act of kindness.

						There may be certain obstacles in your path, but they don’t have to stop you. Don’t give up.
