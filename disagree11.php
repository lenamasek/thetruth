					Many of us feel like we have to continue to achieve, perform, or do something to consistently earn our worth. This creates a very conditional – and exhausting – lifestyle. You may live in shame because you don’t feel valuable. Whatever markers or checkpoints you hold in your life for achieving your worth are arbitrary and subjective. Accepting that you have inherent worth and that you know what’s best for you will free you from the endless cycle of needing to earn your worth. Remember that you have worth and importance just because you exist, and don’t give up.
