					First of all, the way the world measures intelligence is, ironically, an unintelligent system. You definitely have strengths and weaknesses that are important and characterize how you interact with your peers, culture, and environment. Your strengths aren’t everyone’s strengths and your weaknesses aren’t everyone’s weaknesses. Other people may be smarter than you in certain areas, but that does not negate your smartness.</h2><h2>

Secondly, let’s break down the differences between smart, intelligent, and knowledgable. “Smart” refers to being intelligent and intelligence refers to your capability to acquire knowledge. You can be very capable of learning new things, but you haven’t really put much effort into learning. Maybe you’re trying hard to learn but are experiencing some obstacles. Figure out what you need to do to work through those obstacles, but don’t believe the lie that you’re not smart. You are. </h2><h2>

Maybe you don’t remember history or trivia very well, but you can look at something and paint it on a canvas with incredible accuracy. Maybe you don’t write very well, but you can give a speech better than the President. Check out the psychologist Howard Gardner and his Theory of Multiple Intelligences. It's a theory that may help you realize that you can really shine in some areas more than others.</h2><h2>

You’re capable of learning new things, and I’m sure you know a whole bunch about a lot of different things, even right now. Go learn something new! It’s fun. Don’t give up.				</h2>
