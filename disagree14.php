					Your acceptability does not depend on anyone’s willingness to accept you. You are enough just as you are – no matter what anyone says about you, no matter what anyone’s standards are.</h2>
		<h2>			
Advertising, magazines, the news, your friends, your terrible boss, your parents, a mental disorder, and many other things can make you <em>feel</em> inadequate, but that’s not the truth about you. You are good enough just as you are, right now, today. You are valuable and worthy of love and respect. Don’t give up.
