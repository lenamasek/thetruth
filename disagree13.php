					You are a human with value, potential, goals, aspirations. You may not have reached a certain goal yet, but you are not inadequate. Sometimes feelings of inadequacy can keep you from being the person you want to be. It may be difficult to surmount, but getting to know others will help you realize that no one is inferior to anyone else. Everyone is trying to figure life out each day at a time, and no one really knows what they’re doing. Give yourself credit for good things you do and <a href="https://youtu.be/OP3xf6BFEIo">#treatyoself</a>.</h2>
<h2>
No amount of successes or failures you have in your life will enhance or take away your inherent value. You’re great just as you are. Don’t give up.</h2>
