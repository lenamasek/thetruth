					Your value is in your existence. It can’t be earned and it can’t be taken away or lost. You exist, therefore you are valuable. You don’t need to wait until you achieve a certain goal or milestone to be good enough. You’re good enough right now. If someone else doesn’t believe you’re good enough, the issue is with them, not you.

			</h2>
				<h2>Don’t measure yourself by a culturally constructed set of values and believe that outcome is the truth about you. You could be a part of several cultures in your lifetime, but your value will always be the same. You will always be good enough – just as you are.
