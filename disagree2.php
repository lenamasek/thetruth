					First, lets debunk the myth: you do NOT need to love yourself before anyone else can love you. It may be difficult to accept love from others when you’re in a negative state, but people will love you no matter what. You always are good enough to receive it, whether you feel like you are or not. The times that you feel like you deserve love the least is probably when you need it the most. The people who care about you know that. You are loved, you are worthy of love and respect, and you can be loved even on the days when you see nothing in yourself to love.
