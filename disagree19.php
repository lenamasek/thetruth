					Taking care of yourself is responsible – not selfish. When you take care of your needs, wants, and desires, you’re able to be your best self and are likely to more positively benefit others. If your ducks are in a row, you can more effectively help another person get their ducks in a row, too. This doesn’t mean that you should spoil yourself all the time or stop caring about others’ needs. Listen to mind and body; pay attention to your needs so that you seek out what it is that will help you to be healthy and fulfilled. You're worth the time and attention self-care requires.
