					This doesn't refer to being interviewed by the police or respectfully communicating with a loved one. This truth is reminds you that you are a unique individual with your own goals, dreams, aspirations, desires, and characteristics. Your choices are yours and you do not have to defend or explain your choices to someone else for validation. </h2><h2>
If you are happy in your relationship or really enjoying your eclectically colored hair, great! You don’t owe it to anyone to defend your choices. Whatever reason you have for doing something should be good enough for someone else if they care about and respect you. Feeling like you owe them some response could cause you to be untruthful in order to give them the answer you think they’re looking for, among many other negative outcomes. Share with others what you’re comfortable with because you’re in charge of your life and your information.
