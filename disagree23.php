					Beauty is commonly culturally subjective, but it doesn’t have to be. Many times, we look to our culture to define what beauty looks like and then we build an unstable value system around that definition. Sounds pretty arbitrary when you put it that way, doesn’t it? </h2><h2>
Whatever your peers or environment thinks is beautiful may not be what makes you feel beautiful. Explore beauty for yourself! What makes you feel like the most stunning person in the world? What is in the way of you feeling that way? Nobody gets to tell you that you’re not beautiful. No one has the right to that final say except you. Reclaim the judgment on your own appearance – and don’t give up.				</h2>
