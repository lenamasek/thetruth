				Have you ever had a friend or family member tell you what you should or shouldn’t say? They might shush you or censor you at  times. Maybe it’s out of love, maybe it’s out of a desire to control someone else – regardless, you don’t need to follow anyone else’s standard but your own. Others’ value systems are not set up to accommodate what’s in your best interest, so don’t let their expectations of your be the truth about you.</h2><h2>
				You are free to be yourself and the world is better off with you in it. Don’t give up.
