					Your life is significant for many reasons. One of those being that even before you could breathe air, you made a difference in someone’s life. People knew you were coming and they took care of you when you got here. You’ve made an impact on others’ lives for longer than you’ll remember and in more ways than you’ll realize. Your existence changes many people’s lives and is making a mark on our world. Keep being yourself, keep loving people, keep making a difference. Don’t give up.
