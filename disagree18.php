					This message may be different than you think. You don’t deserve love because you did something to earn it. Nothing you do – good or bad – will ever result in you not deserving love. You deserve love because you exist, because you have inherent value, because you’re a human with a brain and a heart and feelings and needs. You deserve love right out of the gate and you always will. Don’t believe the idea that you’re not good enough to be loved. You’re always worthy of love.
