					 You may think you don’t deserve respect because of something you've done, or maybe just a lack of self-confidence. Although you may feel undeserving, the truth is that you do deserve respect. Even if the government rules that your demographic is to be less respected than others, even if someone in your life tells you point-blank that you’re undeserving of respect – that is not the truth about you. </h2>
					 <h2>As a human, respect for you and your life is a given and there’s nothing you can do to be unworthy of that, no matter who says so. Every living being deserves to be treated equally, with love and respect. You are no exception to that and you never will be.
